I started my capstone by working on mapping my design using a website called moqups to make and visualize my layout to see how I wanted to go about using my HTML and CSS.

Home Page:

I made my header for the homepage see-through to match the background gradient making seem like the sun is rising as the user enters the page, in my header I added some nonfunctional buttons just to fill in the visual space and I kept my body simple with just a text box with 2 buttons and an image next to it.

on my parks page, the background is the sunset and I used a table display to display the filter option the user selects (search by location, search by types) I added a function to get the last 3 words from the location name so it can display on the table. The footer has loremipsum and social links and I made the font white so the user can see because the background is dark.

I had a lot of trouble getting the filters to work correctly and at the same time everything just started working but showing undefined eventually after using a consolog a bunch of times finally got it working and correctly displayed the results.
